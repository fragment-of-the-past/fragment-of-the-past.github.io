      <p><strong>3096.</strong><br>
      This is the number of active people who have signed the xELA Terms of Service.<br>
      This is the number of people that have been subject to poor moderation and mistreatment under the Bringus Studios server, without Jon’s knowledge.<br>
      This is the number of people who have been lied to about the status of both the server and multiple people.<br>
      “On Leave” is just an excuse for irresponsibility. “HR” is just a nickname for puppets with no power.<br><br>
      To any staff that receives this message, we beg you to please do what is right. We know that the consequences of leaving the server can affect you, but we have had to endure isolation from the server too. We promise you that when you realize the effect that this action has, it doesn't feel bad at all. So please, join the gradual movement and leave the server. If you choose not to, that is okay. We understand it's a lot to take on. Don't pressure yourself, take the time to make the choice that you believe is for the greater good.<br>
      And Luci.<br>
      Luci, if you are reading this, please sit down and listen. We do not look to blindly criticize. We look for meaningful change.<br>
      You have been hired for the job of head server staff for one reason: To replace another. No one bears the fault of this mismanagement more than you. Why, exactly? You were unqualified for the job. Just like you’ve pointed your bleeding edge at Bacon, you first had to thrust it in yourself. You accepted the position without realizing your limits.<br>
      Maturity is the key trait required for your position. There's a lot to do, no? You are required to manage thousands of people fairly, and deploy a team of like-minded but unique staff to keep a 24/7 watch on said population. You are supposed to not only know your limits, but recognize the limits of others. You are supposed to have a stable track of your mental health so you don’t burn out often. You need to hold the responsibility that falls upon the bearer of this role.<br>
      The disappointing thing?<br>
      You have failed all of these things, and are only now realizing the consequences of your inadequacy. People are noticing. Ray. Ellie. Your most active people. Your effort to silence those who took this sacrifice will eventually fall right back at you. We'd like to challenge this and say that they did not leave due to things going on. They did not leave because they couldn’t do it anymore. They left because they were tired of you. This is not the server that Jon imagined. It has been ruthlessly designed to look like that, but inside, it is falling apart. You can be a good person. But, you truly aren’t qualified for this position. On behalf of all of the “Application crew”:<br>
      Please resign. This is our humble plea. We offered you peace. This is your last warning.<br><br>
      Please do what is right.</p>
